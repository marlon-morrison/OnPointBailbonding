                    <h2>bail bonding info</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Do you get bail money back?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, you can normally get your bail money back no matter if you are convicted or acquitted of your charges. This applies if you pay for the entire bail and do not use a bail bond. If you get a bail bond, the bondsmen will get their full amount back, but you can not get back the 10% premium that is charged – this amount is non-refundable.</p>
                    <p>If you pay the full bail amount in the form of a cash bond to the court, you can have the money returned to you as long as the defendant attends all required court appearances. If the defendant fails to appear in court, however, this amount is forfeited and will not be returned.</p>
                    <h3>Can I get my 10% fee back?</h3>
                    <p>No. This is the service fee the bail agency charges; it is called the Premium. Bail bondsmen take on risk and have to do a variety of things to make this work. The 10% fee is simply a way for them to stay in business. It can not be refunded but there are still ways to get bailed out without a 10% bail bond.</p>
                    <p>The 10% premium is the fee the bail bondsman charges for risking his own money to bail you out of jail. Just like the premium you pay on your car insurance policy, it is not refunded if you don’t wreck your car. A bail bond is a form of insurance that is used to guarantee the appearance of a defendant in a criminal court proceeding. In fact, in many states, bail bondsmen are regulated by the state’s insurance commission.</p>
                    <h3>What is a property bond?</h3>
                    <p>nstead of using cash as bail, one can use property to bail out an individual. Property bonds are not allowed in all states. Check the bail bonds options for your state before pursuing this option. Property bonds can be useful in cases where cash is not an option. Regular bail bonds still require a 10% premium payment, which in some cases may still be too much for those who are low on money.</p>
                    <p> A property bond utilizes the equity people have in their house, commercial building, or vacation home to assure the court the accused person will be present on their scheduled court date(s). If the accused individual does not appear in court, then the property is at risk of being in the hands of the court. Property bonds are a good way of making bail if an individual has equity in their property but very little or no cash.</p>
                    <h3>What are some bail statistics?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bail Bonds Reduce Jail Overcrowding At No Taxpayer Expense</li>
                        <li>Bail Bonds Increase The Likelihood That People Will Show Up For Court</li>
                        <li>Only 40% plead guilty if they can afford a bail bond.</li>
                        <li>Those that can’t afford a bail bond spend an average of 15 days in jail.</li>
                        <li>With a bail bond, 88% get their case dismissed or resolved without a criminal record.</li>
                        <li>Only 38% see their case dismissed or resolved with no record if they can’t afford the bail bond.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What does a bounty hunter do?</h3>
                    <p>A bounty hunter is hired by a bail bondsman to locate and arrest a person who does not show to court as agreed in their bail bond agreement.</p>
                    <p>Bounty hunters are sometimes referred to as bail recovery agents. When a person doesn’t show to court, the bail bondsman is responsible for the full bail bond amount.</p>
                    <h3>What if no money for bail?</h3>
                    <p>Many people get stuck in a situation where they cannot afford the 10% bail bond fee. In that case, even a bail bond may not be financially possible. Let’s assume your bail bond is set at $10,000. This means you have to come up with $1,000 for your 10% of the bail bond. </p>
                    <p>You will not get this money back so it presents a real financial burden. You can choose to stay in jail until your court date and avoid incurring any costs. The issue with that is that you may lose your job or school eligibility which would further set you back long term. It’s vital to obtain the financial resources to be released to avoid further damage to one’s career or whatever daily responsibilities they may hold in their life.</p>
                    <h3>Bail amounts for different crimes?</h3>
                    <p>One thing that utterly confuses many people is the difference in bail between one crime or another. For example, an assault with a deadly weapon may have a $25,000 bail, but a crime of pimping has a $35,000 bail. Murder, sex crimes with minors, and incidents that involve weapons of mass destruction are crimes that have bail amounts that are at least $1 million. Fugitives and prison escapees receive no bail, of course.</p>
                    <p>The authorities set the bail amounts by category, type of crime and more. Misdemeanors naturally do not have bail amounts that are as severe as the ones that apply to felony crimes. The least expensive bails are the ones that go with misdemeanor vehicular crimes.</p>
                    <h3>How to bail from another state?</h3>
                    <p>One of the most important parts in bailing someone out from another state is knowing the bail process and procedure of the state in which the arrest occurred. Since each state has its own rules and processes in how they handle bail, you might not have the same bail options to release your loved one in Nevada as you would in your local jurisdiction of Texas.</p>
                    <p>For example, in Texas, licenses are granted by the board for practicing bail bond sureties. Meanwhile, in Nevada, bail can be posted by any person, which results in completely different procedures in how the arrested person can be released, and who actually can release the person from jail in another state.</p>
                    <h3>Tip for co-signing on bail bonds</h3>
                    <p>A bail bondsman will almost always require a defendant to have one or more co-signers on their bond. For many bondsmen, the co-signer is just as important as the 10% bail bond premium that they will collect from the bond.</p>
                    <p>The reason a co-signer is so important is that a co-signer is an indemnitor. An indemnitor is someone who assumes the responsibility, the risk, and the potential costs related to apprehending the defendant if they fail to appear in court.</p>
                    <h3>How long to get out of jail?</h3>
                    <p>It typically takes 2 to 6 hours to get out of jail after posting bail. After you arrive at the jail, you need to go through photographs, fingerprinting, and the jail needs to input all your information. </p>
                    <p>This process typically takes 1-3 hours. You will then be able to make a phone call to a bail bondsman or a friend or family member. Bail will be posted and it can take as little as 1-2 hours if the jail is small and not busy. However, it can take 4-6 hours if the jail is busy.</p>
                    <h3>Can you leave state on bail?</h3>
                    <p>After posting bail, you can typically leave the state and travel freely if you paid for the bail bond with your own money or the money from someone besides a bail bondsman. There are some cases where the court may limit you from traveling but those cases are rare. No matter what your method of payment was for the bail bond, any court order takes priority so make sure that you know what the terms of your release are.</p>
                    <p>If you were released from jail on a bail bond from a bondsman, you may have a contract with the bondsman that states you are not allowed to leave the state. If you break that contract and leave the state, then you can be arrested.</p>
                    <h3>What is bond surrender?</h3>
                    <p>When a person is out on bail before their court date, the person who paid for the bail bond can “surrender” the person they bailed out by returning them to jail. There are several reasons this could occur. The bail bondsman or whoever paid for the bail bond may feel uncertain about the person showing up for court so they may want to limit their risk and surrender the person back to the jail.</p>
                    <p>Each bail bondsman can have a contract in place with the person they bail out which typically includes terms of scheduled check-ins with the bondsman and possibly other requirements until the court date.</p>
                    <h3>Can I get a free bail bond?</h3>
                    <p>You can avoid the 10% bail bondsman fee if you pay for the bond yourself or have a friend or relative pay for your bail bond and not charge you any interest fees.</p>
                    <p>While this technically makes the bail bond free, there can still be some non-refundable administrative fees to cover the paper work and processing.</p>
                    <h3>How do you qualify for 0% Down Bail Bonds?</h3>
                    <p>Not everyone is eligible for the low down payment options. If you are bailing someone out who is a high flight risk or has previously not attending court dates, then you may not qualify for a low payment option with a Los Angeles bondsman. The bail bond agent may also ask about your financial situation before committing to a low down payment.</p>
                    <p>How is your credit (strong, average, weak)? Do you have any property? If you own a house where you have $75,000 in equity, and the bail bond is $55,000 then the bondsman may give you 0% down because you have enough collateral to offset any risk. When talking to your bondsman, be prepared to answer some of these common questions.</p>
                    <h3>How much for $10,000 bail?</h3>
                    <p>The premium is typically 10-15% in most states. This is the base fee that every bail bonds company will require you to pay. For a $10,000 bail bond, this means $1,000 to $1,500 in costs that you need to pay.</p>
                    <p>Most sources will tell you this is the only fee you will need to pay, but this is not accurate. There are other potential costs associated with $10,000 bail, and any other amount. You may be charged additional fees beyond the $1,000 to $1,500 premium depending on the bonding company, the risk associated with the bond, the location, and many other factors.</p>
                    <h3>How much for $25,000 bail?</h3>
                    <p>The premium is typically 10-15% in most states. This is the base fee that every bail bonds company will require you to pay. For a $25,000 bail bond, this means $2,500 to $3,750 in costs that you need to pay.</p>
                    <p>This amount is non-refundable and you will not be able to get this money back no matter what the outcome of the case is (dismissed, innocent, etc.).</p>
                    <h3>$1 million dollar bond cost</h3>
                    <p>The premium is typically 10-15% in most states. This is the base fee that every bail bonds company will require you to pay. For a $1 million bail bond, this means $100,000 to $150,000 in costs that you need to pay if you want to use a bail bondsman.</p>
                    <p>There is no bail for murder under certain circumstances. Other murder arrests have a $1 million dollar bail that is typically set. Such cases are reviewed closely and can vary in amount due to the threat and risk the person possesses if they were to make bail. Accessory to murder in the 1st degree has slightly lower bail set $500,000 bail amount while 2nd degree is set to $250,000.</p>
